# TIL
- 기록은 모든것의 기본이다. 보고 배운것과 해본것들을 꾸준히 남기도록 한다.
# Principles
- 양이 적더라도 매일 업데이트 하려고 노력하자. 꾸준함이 중요하다.  
- 다시 보았을 때 불편함이 없도록 명료하게 작성한다.
- 이론본다고 코드공부도 게을리하지 않기~!

# 2. 그외 이론및 모델

[Graphical Model?][b_link001] : 상태를 가지는 모델에서 directed/indirected graphical model의 개념이 자주 등장한다.  
[Restricted Boltzmann Machine][b_link002] : 깊은 신경망에서 학습이 잘 되지 않는 문제를 해결하기 위해 Geoffrey Hinton 교수님이 제안하신 방법론  
Gradient vanishing을 사전학습으로 풀어낸다. 이를 통해 DL이 다시 활기를 되찾았다. Generative 계열을 이해하기 위해서는 이해 필수
[MCMC(Monte Carlo Markov Chain)][b_link003] : 샘플링 방법론
[Pytorch Manual][b_link004] : 파이토치 사용매뉴얼
 # Text book 
 [Machine Learning : A Probabilistic Perspective][t_link001] : ML의 바이블이라고 생각하는 책이다. 언젠간 보고 정리해야겠다고 생각했는데, 언제 다볼 수 있을지...
