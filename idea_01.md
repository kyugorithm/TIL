Background and Objective of the Technology

The growing demand for effective content promotion and preview generation on OTT platforms necessitates an automated system for creating medium-length highlights (approximately 10 minutes) that maintain narrative coherence. Traditional manual editing processes are time-consuming, costly, and struggle to maintain consistent quality. This technology aims to develop an AI-powered system that automatically generates highlights while preserving the story's context and core narrative elements.

Key Technical Components

A. Multimodal Information Extraction Phase

Audio stream separation from video content
Speech-to-Text (STT) conversion using high-performance engines

Global level: Processing complete video audio for overall context
Scene level: Processing individual scene audio for detailed context


Scene Boundary Detection implementation
Scene segmentation and temporal alignment

B. Content Analysis Phase

Global narrative analysis and summarization using LLM
Scene-level content summarization

Integration of scene-specific STT data
Visual element analysis
Dialog and audio context analysis


Correlation analysis between global story and scene-level summaries
Context preservation verification

C. Key Scene Selection Phase

LLM-based story importance evaluation algorithm
Inter-scene connectivity analysis for narrative structure preservation
Scene arrangement optimization for viewer engagement
Multi-modal importance scoring system

Text-based relevance from STT data
Visual significance
Audio significance
Narrative contribution weight



D. Highlight Refinement Phase

Shot-level analysis within selected scenes
Shot selection based on:

Visual quality assessment
Story contribution evaluation
Temporal dynamics


Dynamic pruning adjusted to target duration
Transition optimization between selected shots


Distinctive Technical Effects

This system offers several significant advantages:

Maintains narrative coherence while providing compressed content
Reduces production time and costs through AI automation
Ensures consistent highlight quality across different content types
Provides flexibility for various genres and content lengths

Implementation Considerations

Technical aspects requiring careful attention include:

Performance optimization of AI models at each processing stage
Parallel processing architecture design for real-time processing
Interface implementation supporting diverse video formats
Model performance improvement system incorporating user feedback
STT accuracy optimization for various audio conditions
Scene-level audio processing pipeline efficiency
Cross-modal information integration framework
Quality assurance mechanisms for generated highlights


Future Enhancement Possibilities

The system can be extended to include:

Adaptive learning from user engagement metrics
Genre-specific highlighting strategies
Multilingual support for global content
Customizable highlight duration based on target platform
Integration with existing content management systems
Real-time highlight generation capabilities
Automated A/B testing for highlight effectiveness

This technology represents a significant advancement in automated content processing for OTT platforms, promising to enhance both operational efficiency and user experience through intelligent highlight generation. The multi-level STT processing ensures comprehensive understanding of both global and local context, leading to more coherent and engaging highlights.
The system's modular design allows for continuous improvement and adaptation to evolving content formats and platform requirements. By leveraging state-of-the-art AI technologies across multiple modalities, it provides a robust solution for automated highlight generation while maintaining the essential narrative elements of the original content.
