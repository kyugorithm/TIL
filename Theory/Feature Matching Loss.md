# Feature matching loss
  
## Introduction
In GAN-related papers that perform image to image translation tasks, feature matching loss term is often used.  
The cases and explanations used in several papers are summarized to help understand Feature Matching Loss.  

## 1. FUNIT : Few-Shot Unsupervised Image-to-Image Translation
The feature matching loss **regularizes** the training.  
1. Remove the last layer of D and construct feature extractor **Df**  
2. Use Df to extract features from the translation output **xÂ¯** and the class images {y1, ..., yK} and minimize

Unlike other papers, the target class is set to K, not one.  
Therefore, for each class, the value obtained through the Feature Extractor is forced to be equal to the average of all other classes.
