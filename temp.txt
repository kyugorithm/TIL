	1.	Logo Detection:
	•	Crop images containing logos from video sequences. High redundancy ensures most logos are detected even if some frames fail.
	2.	Feature Extraction:
	•	From cropped logos and existing image databases for content-based image retrieval.
	3.	Grouping:
	•	Based on similarity using extracted feature vectors.
	4.	OCR Processing:
	•	Perform OCR on representative images from each group.
	•	Text-Based Retrieval: Use OCR results for additional text retrieval.
	5.	Retrieval Failure Handling:
	•	Fallback: Use Google Image Search to identify brands if initial retrieval fails.
	•	Text Analysis: Use language models like ChatGPT to analyze text information for brand identification.
	6.	Database Update:
	•	Validation: Media operation members validate results.
	•	Update DB: Incorporate validated results into image and vector databases to improve future retrieval accuracy.
