Coding Test: 3.5/5


Demonstrated problem-solving skills and understanding of optimization, but didn't immediately present more complex algorithms or highly efficient solutions.
Proposed ideas for improving space complexity, but couldn't implement the optimal solution on the spot.


Technical Understanding: 4/5


Showed deep understanding of ML, speech recognition, and deep learning architectures.
Has experience with AWS, WebSockets, and asynchronous server construction, but limited mention of cutting-edge trends or more advanced technologies.
Lack of direct experience in the vision domain is a drawback.


Project Experience: 4.5/5


Impressive experience with diverse and complex projects such as real-time speech recognition, speaker identification, and audio watermarking.
Has experience in large-scale system optimization and demonstrated practical problem-solving skills.
Lack of B2C experience and vision-related project experience prevents a perfect score.

Overall Evaluation: 4/5
The candidate clearly possesses excellent technical skills and experience. However, considering that their experience doesn't perfectly align with Coupang Play's requirements (vision-related work, B2C experience), and the fact that they couldn't immediately provide optimal solutions in the coding test, it's difficult to give the highest score.
Nevertheless, considering the candidate's learning ability and deep experience in various ML domains, they are still deemed a suitable candidate for the ML engineer position at Coupang Play. However, it would be necessary to further verify their ability to quickly adapt to the vision field and B2C environment.
