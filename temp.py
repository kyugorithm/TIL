I am pleased to recommend Abdul Muqeet for your PhD program. As his team leader at Vive Studios, I had the privilege of working closely with him for over a year. During this time, he consistently demonstrated strong research skills and a deep commitment to driving innovation.

Abdul graduated with excellent grades from Kyung Hee University, one of South Korea's top institutions and a dream university for many. His academic accomplishments reflect his dedication, intellectual curiosity, and his ability to thrive in a highly competitive environment.

At Vive Studios, Abdul made notable contributions to several impactful projects. In the Video Face Re-aging project, he introduced a new approach that reduced processing time by 30% while maintaining temporal consistency and preserving identity. His work was successfully integrated into our production pipeline, adding commercial value. In the ToonAging project, he developed a one-step pipeline that outperformed traditional methods, with 45% of users favoring his results. These projects demonstrated his ability to solve complex challenges and deliver innovative, practical solutions.

Abdulâ€™s greatest strengths lie in his systematic approach to problem-solving and his technical integration skills. As his team leader, I witnessed his ability to listen to and integrate diverse viewpoints from team members to identify key issues and propose creative, practical solutions. For example, in the face re-aging project, while others focused on improving generative quality, he emphasized the importance of temporal consistency and identity-preserving generation, developing actionable strategies to address these challenges. These abilities will be crucial for the Development of a 3D Morphable Model of Prenatal Human Faces, where capturing subtle morphological changes is essential.

One standout example of Abdul's interdisciplinary thinking was his work on virtual production environments at Vive Studios. This project combined computer vision and computer graphics, requiring a deep understanding of virtual production techniques. Abdul proposed a cost-effective alternative to traditional LED walls, which are expensive and resource-heavy. By using generative AI and advanced rendering methods, he created a solution that reduced operational costs while maintaining high visual quality. His ability to bridge these two fields and deliver a practical, innovative solution showcases his interdisciplinary expertise, which will be invaluable for your proposed PhD project.

In conclusion, Abdul is a highly skilled and motivated researcher with a strong record of academic excellence and innovative contributions. His ability to tackle interdisciplinary challenges and deliver results makes him an ideal candidate for your program. I am confident that he will thrive in the proposed PhD project and make valuable contributions to your academic community.
