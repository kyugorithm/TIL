Recommendation: Hire with Reservations
The candidate has valuable experience but shows limitations in independent problem-solving. Their strength lies in maintaining and optimizing existing systems rather than developing novel solutions. Consider team composition and immediate project needs when making final decision. If hired, recommend implementing a mentoring plan to strengthen algorithmic problem-solving skills and independent solution development abilities.
