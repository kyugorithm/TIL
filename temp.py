Here's my evaluation of the interview in English:

Coding Test (4.5/5)
Immediate and accurate problem comprehension and analysis
Self-derived optimization from O(n²) to O(n)
Suggested improvements considering space complexity
Excellent algorithmic thinking beyond just implementation
Technical Understanding (4.5/5)
Deep understanding of fundamental deep learning concepts (CNN, Receptive Field)
Practical understanding of generative models (VAE, VQVAE, Diffusion)
Diverse domain knowledge in Audio Processing, Motion Generation
Research paper writing and presentation experience (SIGGRAPH ASIA)
Understanding of current technical trends like multi-discriminator approach
Project Experience (4/5)
Development of Motion Capture post-processing automation system
Backend implementation experience with FastAPI
Deployment pipeline construction using Docker
Data management using S3
Participation in labeling tool development
Strengths:

Comprehensive understanding of ML pipeline from R&D to service implementation
Excellent problem-solving abilities and optimization thinking
Strong willingness to learn new technologies with deep understanding
Strong foundation in both theoretical and practical aspects of ML
Weaknesses:

Relatively limited hands-on experience with cloud infrastructure like AWS
Less experience in engineering-focused work ※ However, these can be easily overcome given their demonstrated quick learning ability and problem-solving skills
Overall Assessment (4.3/5):
The candidate demonstrates outstanding technical capabilities and problem-solving skills, with a solid foundation as an ML Engineer. While their experience is currently more research-focused, they show strong motivation to transition to engineering and have proven their ability to quickly acquire necessary technical skills. They appear to be an excellent fit for the company's vision-related projects, and I strongly recommend them for the position.

The candidate's combination of deep technical knowledge, problem-solving abilities, and willingness to learn makes them a valuable potential addition to the team. Their slight lack of engineering experience is outweighed by their strong fundamental capabilities and quick learning ability. I recommend proceeding with their candidacy.
